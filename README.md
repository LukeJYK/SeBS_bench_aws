Hello! This repository is the testing benchmark for serverless computing, you can use AWS Lambda to test it. This repo is generated from 
SeBS benchmark (Middleware '21). All the testing code is written in Python, make sure you have already set up the S3 buckets before testing.

This is used for MUG'23 Poster sesion (Cold start and execution time in serverless computing), and the graph can be found in the ./plot.
